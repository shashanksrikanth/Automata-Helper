# Automata-Helper

Before we go forward, the acronyms used in this guide are:
1. DFA: deterministic finite automaton
2. NFA: non-deterministic finite automaton

## Overview
This is a tool built using Java that helps with the following tasks:
1. Checking if a word is accepted by a DFA
2. Checking if a word is accepted by a NFA
3. Converting a DFA to a NFA
4. Completing a DFA
The logic behind these algorithms can be found online, or in the book *Introduction to the Theory of Computation*, by Michael Sipser. Note that the algorithms in this repo are based on the explanation given by Sipser.

## How to run the code
Before running this, clone the repo first. Open an IDE of your preference, and then run **Main.java**.

## Further work
Further work can consist of adding functionality that can change a regular expression into a NFA or a NFA into a regular expression. It can also consist of packaging the application as a JAR file, and only having to run the JAR file.
